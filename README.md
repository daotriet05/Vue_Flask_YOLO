# YOLO models inference with Vue-Flask Application
- I build this web for practice how to use APIs and Flask backend
- In this app, I used Vue.js as the Frontend, connecting to Flask backend
- My app is a tool that users can use to upload an image and receive the image processed by YOLO models. Users can choose which version they want to use (YOLOv8, YOLOv9, or YOLOv10)
